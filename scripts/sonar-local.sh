# Local SonarQube analysis for csc-api (Java/Maven).
# Spins up an ephemeral SonarQube Community container, runs mvn package with
# JaCoCo coverage, then mvn sonar:sonar against the local instance, and
# prints the quality gate + open issues.
# Usage: ./scripts/sonar-local.sh
#
# Requires Docker (the build itself uses TestContainers for PostgreSQL, MySQL,
# Keycloak and Toxiproxy).
#
# IMPORTANT — Limitation of ephemeral SonarQube:
# The SonarQube container is freshly started on every run, so it has no
# previous analysis to use as a "new code" baseline. The Quality Gate's
# new-code conditions therefore evaluate trivially OK and do NOT match the
# behaviour you'll see on SonarCloud (where a real baseline exists). To
# approximate PR-style focus locally, this script intersects the Sonar
# issue list with `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` and reports only
# issues on changed files. Use it as a smoke-check; treat SonarCloud on
# the actual PR as authoritative.
